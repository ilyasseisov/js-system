              ... that one in five developers experiences daily frustration? 🤯
              They feel that they don't truly understand JS or that they are not
              as proficient as they should be.😕 And it is not surprising!

            <p class="body-text-adaptive mb-xs-12px mb-md-20px mb-xl-24px">
              JS as a language grows and evolves daily. There are 25+ Javascript
              frameworks 🤬 and countless libraries that change regularly or
              become obsolete. It's natural for developers to feel overwhelmed
              😬 by the constant need to learn and adapt.

            <p class="body-text-adaptive mb-xs-12px mb-md-20px mb-xl-24px">
              It is worth mentioning that in the vast JS ocean, there are plenty
              of poorly written documentation and amateur tutorials. It can
              drive crazy 😵‍💫 even an experienced developer.

              You know Javascript theory, solved challenges, practiced
              exercises, and watched videos & courses. But when it comes to
              real-world projects, even a small one - you feel stuck and
              disappointed. 🙁

              After hours of learning you still get stuck 🤔 at typical project

              Let me tell my story, it was 2015 and I have finished “JavaScript:
              The Definitive Guide” 📖 by David Flanagan. I remember while
              reading this book I felt that I understood the concepts of
              Javascript. And I have even reproduced small code pieces on my
              computer. I felt smart and strong 💪🏼 until…
            </p>
            <p class="body-text-adaptive mb-xs-12px mb-md-20px mb-xl-24px">
              Until I decided to do some small project (it was a sidebar or
              popup). I felt completely stuck. 😵‍💫 I didn't know how to approach
              the task. Felt lost.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text-adaptive mb-xs-12px mb-md-20px mb-xl-24px">
              It was kind of surprising and a bit disappointing. 😕 I could do
              well with the tasks from the book, but when it came to real tasks,
              even the small ones, I struggled.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text-adaptive mb-xs-12px mb-md-20px mb-xl-24px">
              Then history repeated itself in 2022 when I started learning
              React.js. The same exact pattern.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text-adaptive mb-xs-12px mb-md-20px mb-xl-24px">
              But luckily I already knew what to do - had the action plan. ✅
