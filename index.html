              Did you know that one in five developers experiences daily
              frustration? ü§Ø They feel that they don't truly understand JS or
              that they are not as proficient as they should be. And it is not
              surprising!

              JS as a language grows and evolves daily. There are 25+ Javascript
              frameworks and countless libraries that change regularly or become
              obsolete. It's natural for developers to feel overwhelmed by the
              constant need to learn and adapt.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text-adaptive mb-xs-12px mb-md-20px mb-xl-24px">
              It is worth mentioning that in the vast JS ocean, there are plenty
              of poorly written documentation and amateur tutorials. It can
              drive crazy even an experienced developer.
